## Deploying to GitHub Pages

This project is configured for static export so it can be published on GitHub Pages:

- Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH` to your repository name (for example, `plasmic`) when running `npm run build` so assets and routes are generated with the correct base path.
- After building, the static site is available in the `out/` directory and includes a `.nojekyll` marker for GitHub Pages.
- Upload the `out/` directory to the `gh-pages` branch (or configure the Pages source to use it) to preview the site.
